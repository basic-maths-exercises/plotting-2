# Plotting linear functions

Lets now build on what you know by thinking about how to write programs to draw graphs of mathematical functions rather than sequences.  In particular, let's consider the function:

__Write a program that uses a for loop to generate the y values of this function for integer values of x from 0 up to and including 50.  You should then draw a graph that shows these y values against the corresponding x values.__
